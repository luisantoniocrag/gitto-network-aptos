## What is Gitto Network?

**Gitto Network** is a protocol for open and *decentralized communities*, offering a series of tools such as smart contracts, SDKs, and libraries to generate interoperable and composable communities.

Imagine building your next social network or community site with Gitto Network tools, aligning what you need and giving your users the power to keep their data safe and even a decentralized shared-revenue scheme.
